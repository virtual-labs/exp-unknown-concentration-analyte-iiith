1. This method involves measuring the absorbance of the sample solution using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. One needs to prepare a stock solution and Calibration Standards from this stock solution.
2. Prepare a standard K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> aqueous solution of strength nearly 3x10<sup>-3</sup> M in 0.01 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (for the experiments described here we have used a solution of strength = 3.16x10<sup>-3</sup> M. This is used as stock solution.
3. From the above stock solution, prepare five different concentrations of K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> solutions: say, 0.158 mM, 0.316 mM, 0.474 mM, 0.632 mM, and 0.790 mM.
4. Switch on the computer and the instrument powers; wait for 30 minutes for 'warm-up' of the instrument.
5. In the instrument one can select light sources (UV and visible), choose the slit width, scan speed and %transmittance or absorbance display, wavelength range of interest, etc.
6. Take two clean and dry glass (only for visible range scan) or quartz cuvettes with a given path length (say, 1 cm).
7. Fill up one cuvette with sample blank (aq. 0.01 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the present case) and the other cuvette with aqueous K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> solution with lowest concentration.
8. Place the sample blank in the reference holder and the sample in the sample holder.
9. Run the scan (A or %T versus λ).
10. Similarly spectral runs are done for all the other samples starting from the lowest concentrations to next higher concentrations of K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub>. Every time one should rinse the cuvette taking a small portion of the solution to be analyzed next.
11. Spectral run is carried out for the unknown K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> sample.
12. Now find out the wavelengths of maximum absorbance (λ <sub>max<sub> ), the absorbance at a given λ <sub>max<sub> for all the concentrations of K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> and make a table containing these data.
13. Construct a calibration plot by plotting absorbance versus concentration for a given λ <sub>max</sub> . Thus one construct two calibration plots for two peak positions of K <sub>2</sub> Cr <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub>.
14. Determine the slopes of the calibration plots and hence the respective values of λ's.
15. Determine the concentration of the unknown K <sub>2</sub> r <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> solution from two calibration plots.
